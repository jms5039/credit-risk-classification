# Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Background

In this Challenge, various techniques are employed to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. The dataset used contains historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company, aiming to build a model capable of identifying the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Instructions

The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

1. Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.
   - A value of 0 in the “loan_status” column means that the loan is healthy. A value of 1 means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.
3. Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.

### Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

1. Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).
2. Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model.
3. Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:
   - Generate a confusion matrix.
   - Print the classification report.
4. Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

## Overview of the Analysis

In this analysis, machine learning models were employed to assess credit risk for loans. The purpose was to build models capable of identifying the creditworthiness of borrowers using historical lending activity data from a peer-to-peer lending services company.

The dataset included various financial information on loan applicants, such as loan amount, interest rate, employment length, and other relevant features. The main variable of interest was the "loan_status" column, where a value of 0 indicated a healthy loan, and a value of 1 indicated a high risk of defaulting.

The machine learning process involved several stages:
1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
2. Model selection: Choosing appropriate algorithms for binary classification tasks. In this analysis, logistic regression was primarily used.
3. Model training: Fitting the chosen model using the training data.
4. Model evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and generating a confusion matrix.

## Results

* Logistic Regression Model:
    * Accuracy Score: 99%
    * Precision Score (label 0): 100%
    * Precision Score (label 1): 85%
    * Recall Score (label 0): 99%
    * Recall Score (label 1): 91%

## Summary

The logistic regression model performed exceptionally well in predicting both healthy loans and high-risk loans. It achieved an accuracy score of 99%, with high precision and recall scores for both labels. For healthy loans (label 0), the model achieved perfect precision and recall scores, indicating near-perfect performance. For high-risk loans (label 1), the model showed good precision and recall, capturing a significant portion of the actual high-risk loans.

Considering the high accuracy and well-balanced precision and recall scores, I recommend using the logistic regression model for credit risk assessment. However, it's essential to note that the performance may vary depending on the problem being addressed. For instance, if the focus is on minimizing the risk of high-risk loans, optimizing the model for higher recall for label 1 might be necessary. Overall, the logistic regression model demonstrates robust performance and is suitable for credit risk analysis tasks.
